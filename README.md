# Connect4-using-haskell
This is a connect 4 game I created for my functional course final project using Haskell. It's capable of playing connect 4 1 on1 with a real person or play with the build-in AI

The gameboard is a 6x6 matrix and you get to insert your piece at any column. The game is simple. Pieces will drop on top of each other and who connects 4 of their own piece, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, wins the game. A wed-app connect 4 is available here for example: https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html.
